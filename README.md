# 1. Volume and Brightness Controller Using Hand Gesture

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Volume and Brightness Controller Using Hand Gesture" project! This innovative project uses computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control the brightness and volume of a device. The project is implemented in Python and relies on various tools and libraries, including OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe, NumPy, PyCaw, and Screen Brightness Control.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Control:** Use hand gestures to adjust both brightness and volume.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** The project offers real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **Adaptive Control:** Brightness and volume dynamically adapt based on hand gestures.
- **Visual Feedback:** A user-friendly interface provides visual feedback during interaction.

## Requirements

Before you can run the project, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install "Library_name"
```
